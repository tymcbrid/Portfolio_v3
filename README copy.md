Version two of my portfolio. I decided to create a new repo so that I could keep all versions of the portfolio. I originally wanted to use the swiper functionality that is on the home page, but bit off more than I could chew given the time constraint. I will utilize it instead for a short journey through career highlights, in addition to the projects page.
